Important Concepts
==================

As you learn about the pp2 language, keep these important facts and concepts in mind:

 * All **control flow** (if, for, while), **functions** (print), **operators** (and, or, less_than), and **types** (tuple, seq, string) are **implemented at a library level**. There are no language features or builtins that cannot be re-implemented from scratch by code that you write yourself!
 * pp2 is a **lexically-scoped, dynamically-typed language**. That means that variables only exist for as long as you can see them in a program, and that types are attached to individual values, not to the variables that reference them.
